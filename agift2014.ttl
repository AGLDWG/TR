In the thesaurus you will find:

Function – the broadest unit of business performed by Australian Governments' Interactive Functions Thesaurus
Level 2 – major tasks or areas of service undertaken within each function
Level 3 – topics being addressed within function/activities
For each term, the thesaurus shows:
Scope Notes – notes that provide guidance on the use of a term
Broader Terms – terms at a higher level
Narrower Terms – terms at a lower level
Related Terms – terms at the same level
Use – approved terms used to identify and save documents

  rdfs:comment """The Australian Governments’ Interactive Functions Thesaurus (AGIFT) is a three-level hierarchical thesaurus that describes the business functions carried out across Commonwealth, state and local governments in Australia.

It contains 25 high-level functions, each with second and third level terms, as well as non-preferred terms and related terms. Its main purpose is to describe web-based resources to aid online discovery of government information and services.

Terms can be searched by function, alphabetically and via full-text searching.

In the thesaurus you will find:

Function – the broadest unit of business performed by Australian Governments' Interactive Functions Thesaurus
Level 2 – major tasks or areas of service undertaken within each function
Level 3 – topics being addressed within function/activities
For each term, the thesaurus shows:
Scope Notes – notes that provide guidance on the use of a term
Broader Terms – terms at a higher level
Narrower Terms – terms at a lower level
Related Terms – terms at the same level
Use – approved terms used to identify and save documents
Non-preferred Term – other terms, not to be used to identify and save documents"""^^xsd:string ;
